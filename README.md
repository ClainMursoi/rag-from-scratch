# RAG From Scratch

A minimal implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation without frameworks.

## Why this project
Most RAG tutorials hide key decisions behind abstractions.  
This project exposes chunking, retrieval, and evaluation choices explicitly.

## Architecture
Document → Chunk → Embed → Retrieve → Generate

## Experiments
- Fixed vs overlapping chunking
- Retrieval recall@k

## Key Takeaways
(TBD)
